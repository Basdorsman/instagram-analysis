I knew that I wasn‚Äôt the only one - I couldn‚Äôt be; and I‚Äôve always been keen on bringing more awareness around it.

What I hope for the podcast is to provide a safe space for others to open up since you‚Äôre never alone in feeling like this.

Expectations are that the circumstances towards the end of August will allow for that. We are, of course, hopeful and optimistic.
üîπThe Ministry of Education, Culture and Science has formulated a ‚Äúbase scenario‚Äù (in Dutch) and the OMT will issue a definitive recommendation in early July. As it currently stands, expectations for the new academic year are that higher education institutions will be allowed to open their doors, social distancing will no longer be required, and voluntary self-tests will remain available for those who are not vaccinated. 
üîπFace masks will likely remain compulsory while walking through the buildings, however, and we are currently operating under the assumption that lectures will be subject to a maximum of 75 persons starting from September. Naturally, we hope that this restriction will also be lifted.
üîπThe UvA‚Äôs focus is on a return to on-campus education and being able to meet each other.  For students, that means that from September on, lectures will once again require you to be present in Amsterdam. The normal attendance requirements will be in effect. This also applies to foreign students. Only in special cases, e.g. for foreign students who are unable to attend due to international travel restrictions, programmes may explore additional solutions to enable students to receive education. 
üîπThe decision to ‚Äúreturn to normal‚Äù education is based on current developments. While we remain optimistic, we are also taking into account less ideal scenarios in which we have to (partly or temporarily) revert to online education.

Heleen üí¨: ‚ÄúPeople with albinism do not have natural protection against UV rays. Sunscreen is therefore a very important and live saving protective utility for them, as it has proven to reduce the risks of skin cancer considerably. Regrettably, it‚Äôs almost impossible to obtain sunscreen in Togo and therefore I found it important to do something about this.
