On that day, attention is paid to the moment a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or other person (LGBT+) openly expresses a sexual orientation or gender identity: ‘coming out’. This is not a one-off event, because a new context with new people always requires a new legitimation or acceptance of someone's gender and / or sexuality. A (first) coming out can therefore be personal and vulnerable, but it is often experienced as a relief afterwards. What does that mean?

In this video, 5 students share their opinion on Coming Out Day❤️

Rick: “When I was younger and living abroad, I had no choice than to pick up the local language. Ever since, I am intrigued by the science of language learning. And in addition to that, I don’t like feeling like a tourist when I am visiting a country 😁

I was supposed to go to South Korea after finishing my Bachelor’s degree past summer, but unfortunately that did not happen. I would like to live and work there for at least a few years in the future. So, having an (basic) understanding of the language is only going to be beneficial. Therefore, I started learning Korean during the lockdown. And also because Chinese or Japanese seemed too difficult to me (for now), ha-ha. I believe language learning is good for personal development and widening your view on the world by understanding how different cultures work. The Korean language is pleasant to the ears because of the specific intonation and the avoidance of hard consonants like the infamous Dutch letter ‘G’.

A quote I live by is “mind over matter”. I think it’s more important than ever before to focus on the things you can control. See the positives in life like grabbing a coffee with a friend or going for a walk. Try to invest in yourself a little more during these difficult times.”

We are hoping for an announcement next week that students in higher education will be able to return to the UvA more often from 26 April onwards, but the government has postponed its decision on the matter. Preparations are being made, and we have some news about additional study spaces and how self-testing will work in the future🔮.
🔹The University Library is working with the faculties to expand the number of study spaces at the various campuses. So when the measures are indeed relaxed a bit, this will allow us to safely offer the highest possible number of students a space. By now, 2,300 spaces have been created. We are also working on collaboration spaces where students will be able to work together in limited numbers📚.
🔹A relaxation of the measures for higher education will go hand in hand with the provision of self-tests. We are currently working hard to make these tests🧪 available to students and staff free of charge. At least two tests per person per week are scheduled to be available soon.
These will be available through Surfspot, with instructions on how to use them. 
🔹Taking a self-test will always be voluntary. We will not check at the door whether you have taken one, nor will you have to show proof of a negative test. Other measures (1.5-metre, face masks😷, etc.) will continue to apply.
However, we do hope that you consider taking a test before coming to the UvA. This will allow us all to contribute to a safe campus and possible further relaxations of the measures by the government.",2021-04-15 11:34:56,22

There are no changes for education at the moment. The new rules with regard to group size - maximum 30 people inside and 40 people outside - do not apply to the education sector. This applies to in-person education👥, student desks and libraries🏢, graduation and diploma ceremonies🎓 and study association activities📚. 
🔹Events that are education- or research-related, such as small-scale symposia and graduation ceremonies, can take place; naturally the events protocol, relevant UvA protocols and RIVM guidelines continue to apply. Events that are not education or research-related will not be able to take place until at least 20 October. 
🔹Everyone is asked to work from home💻, unless there is no other option. Exceptions to this are necessary activities that cannot be performed from home, such as scheduled in-person education, research and facilities management. Non-essential ‘hybrid’ work will be phased out. For those who really cannot work from home, the (limited) possibility to come to campus remains, just as in March and April. 
🔹UvA buildings are not open to the public and therefore there is no obligation to wear a mask😷. We will continue to follow the current protocols, which guarantee that we can stay 1.5 m away from each other in UvA buildings. Employees and students are of course free to choose to wear a face mask. We will continue to be in contact with the safety region and other educational institutions on this subject. 
🔹There is no travel advice specifically for the Amsterdam region🚃. The familiar rules remain in force, both indoors and outdoors on campus: keep your distance from each other; use the stairs rather than the lifts if possible; reserve your study place and follow the instructions; walking routes; hygiene regulations.

These will apply for at least the coming four weeks. Below, you can read more about how these measures will impact the University of Amsterdam (UvA).
🔹In the short term, the government intends to make wearing face masks a legal requirement. At the UvA, this means that from now on, everyone will be wearing a face mask😷 in all indoor areas (corridors, lifts, halls, etc.) including the library until arriving at their destination. Once in a lecture room or office, face masks may be removed. If you prefer to continue wearing one, feel free to do so. In some spaces (e.g. laboratories)🥼 special guidelines apply, which take precedence over general UvA guidelines.
🔹Teaching activities at universities are exempt to the rule that gatherings must be in groups of 30 and under🧑‍🏫. Examinations can also continue without any group size limitations, although of course all the necessary precautionary measures will be taken. Study spaces👩‍💻 will also remain available for use. Students will be informed when any scheduled activities are cancelled.
🔹Teaching-related activities such as degree certificate and diploma award ceremonies🎓🥳 may continue, with a maximum of 30 people in attendance. In order to restrict travel as much as possible, considering any alternatives first, such as online options, is recommended. Unfortunately, a reception after the award ceremony is currently out of the question. 
🔹At an earlier point, events that were not directly related to education and research had already been postponed🔜. This will now also apply to events that are indeed related to education and research, such as small-scale symposia. Study association activities must also be cancelled, including those of an educational nature. Here too, the four-week period applies.

In this manner you can be safe at home but you don't have to feel lonely. In addition, most student associations have counselors to whom students can turn to when something is going on. For example when students feel a little low or lonely. There are also activities open to non-members.""

This week we visit Guusje’s room. She's 21 years old and is doing a BA student in Communication Science. 

Guusje: “I knew from a young age that I wanted to study in the big city, in Amsterdam. Before I managed to get this room, I lived in the Bijlmer neighbourhood, in the student hotel Casa and in an attic room at the Biesbosstraat. I’m glad I’ve finally found a spot that I really love. In this apartment I really feel at home, a feeling that I didn't experience in my previous rooms. During the process of searching for the right room, I sometimes thought: it’ll never happen... But my tip is: don’t give up hope, persistence always wins! 💪

Despite the fact that I really love it here, the hanging plant about my table does irritate me. To water it, I need to climb on my wobbly table. (Side note: while doing the interview, the UvA social team was also scared she’d fall and break some bones 🤪). But the plant is too cute to get rid of. My favourite item in my room is right underneath the plant – my wooden dachshund. I have a small collection of dachshund items. This one reminds me of my own miniature dachshund, who is currently living with my parents.” 🐾

🔹Both students and study advisers have expressed a need for one-to-one meetings on campus. These are now made possible in some cases if an online meeting does not suffice. Students can consult study advisers about their academic career as well as concerning problems caused by their studies or personal matters that are affecting the latter and their ability to study.
These meetings are by appointment🕰️. Of course the 1½-metre rule will apply and all other measures will remain in place. Students can find further information on study advisers in the A-Z list for their degree programme.
🔹If necessary, degree certificates👨‍🎓 can now be picked up from the reception desk by appointment. The procedure is the same as it was in autumn 2020. The exact details will vary from faculty to faculty and from degree programme to degree programme.
🔹We previously reported that we are working hard on preparing for any easing of the restrictions for higher education which might take place at the end of April.

Matt: “My flatmate and I had an appointment in the city. We showed up five minutes early and saw two people standing outside a building, who just happened to a landlord and real estate agent. After chatting to them, we immediately got a tour around the apartment and that night we got an offer to be the renters of the apartment 😱 

I’ve lived here since January 2020 so I’ve experienced Amsterdam in a really unique time. Living in the city centre is very convenient, location wise, but if I have to name something which I get annoyed by it’s for sure the church bells ringing every 15 minutes 🔔 They are beautiful, don't get me wrong, but there are times when I want to sleep but I can’t. My best option are my earplugs although they also don’t work all the time. An advantage, however, is that I’m always very aware of the time 😉”

Some of our professors have their own outlook on Blue Monday. Their insights💡:

Reinout Wiers, professor of Developmental Psychopathology and co-director of the Centre for Urban Mental Health💬: ‘Almost half of the people meet lifetime criteria for a mental disorder; most prevalent are anxiety, depression and addictions. On Blue Monday, or another blue day during lockdown, this may be bearable, because we're all in the same boat. It becomes difficult when everyone else is having fun, and you can only watch through your window or telephone-screen.’

Claudi Bockting, professor in Clinical Psychology and co-director of the Centre for Urban Mental Health💬: Blue Monday is made up by advertising agencies to sell more sun vacations. There are effective treatments for depression and anxiety; a sun holiday is not amongst them. Interdisciplinary research, as executed in the Center for Urban Mental Health at our university, is crucial to achieve a breakthrough in this field.’",2021-01-18 16:21:36,9

Shirin: ""I was a bit anxious when I decided to go to Amsterdam and find a place on my own. It felt weird to go from being around my family all the time to live in a room alone. I feel very lucky to get a spot in student housing where all my roommates have the same vibes and energy as I do. We have a shared kitchen and hang out there (or in each other’s room) a lot. You’re never really alone here. 

👉 My advice for international students who want to apply for UvA Housing: get an overview of the districts in Amsterdam and decide where you want to live. When the application opens, be quick and make sure you're on time. If you’re not applying via UvA Housing, be aware of Facebook scams.

I knew that I wasn’t the only one - I couldn’t be; and I’ve always been keen on bringing more awareness around it. I love podcasts and how soothing they are to listen to, and I thought it was a great idea to start my own to raise more awareness for mental health.
