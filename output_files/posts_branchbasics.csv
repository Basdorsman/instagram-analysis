SVOCs vs VOCs⁠,<Post CcTGVsBroVD>,150,0,[],13/04/22,"SVOCs vs VOCs⁠

Homes with poor ventilation can be vulnerable to the buildup of SVOCs and VOCs. We’re breaking down each below👇
⁠
SVOCs (semi volatile organic compounds):⁠
🔵 Odorless compounds that ride on dust and increase over time ⁠
🔵 Slowly released from materials such as insulation, furniture, certain cookware, pesticides, and many other products ⁠
🔵 Remove SVOCs by dusting + cleaning frequently or using air purifiers⁠
⁠
VOCs (volatile organic compounds):⁠
🟢 Aromatic compounds that generally reduce over time⁠
🟢 Can be released into indoor air from cleaning and personal care products, air fresheners, scented candles, new furniture, and more⁠
🟢 Choose fragrance free products or outgas strong smelling materials to reduce VOCs

Why choose a,<Post CcNxQnYsXWK>,476,35,[],11/04/22,"Why choose a HEPA vacuum...⁠
⁠
Cleaning with the wrong vacuum can actually contribute to allergic reactions, asthma, and other illness. Most vacuum cleaners exhaust the very dust that was just collected back into the air, making the area more contaminated than before.⁠
⁠
A HEPA vacuum that has a certified sealed system should be used to ensure that the finest dust is picked up and that no particulates leak out at junctures where hoses and nozzles connect. ⁠
⁠
Some of our favorite HEPA vacuum brands include Miele, Shark, or Nilfisk.

Filmed this forever,<Post CcGN9gjAODO>,882,27,[],08/04/22,"Filmed this forever ago (before I was pregnant!) and finally put it together for y’all! 

Here’s how I get stains out of my slipcovers and make them bright white again with Branch Basics: 

1. Spot treat with All-Purpose or Bathroom Spray

2. Remove the slipcovers

3. Soak with 2-3 scoops Oxygen Boost + 1 TBS-ish of Concentrate. I go heavy on the Oxygen Boost in the tub & washing machine b/c I find it makes soak time less. I also soak and wash in multiple loads so the fabric has space to spread out and isn’t super bunched up. 

4. Wash in the machine with capful of Laundry + scoop of Oxygen Boost 

5. Air dry (if the fabric can shrink) 

6. Soften in dryer on low heat

7. Put slipcovers back on (ignore where my daughter cut holes with scissors! 🙈) 

For couches without removable fabric, spot treat stains with All-Purpose and agitate with a damp rag. Use distilled water to avoid mineral rings! You can also test Oxygen Boost in a hidden spot to make sure it doesn’t pull color from the fabric, and agitate in with the All-Purpose if all good. 

Some really heavy stains may take a few rounds of treating, but in the end your couch will likely look new again! ✨

P.S. I vary the water temperature for soaking and washing based on the delicateness of the fabric. For these linen slipcovers, I stick to cold/lukewarm temp. For more durable, I’d try warm or hot.",1370,"[{'text': 'I didn’t put slip covers on my sofa and sofa is off white , what best way to take stain of sofa with the spray b/c I can’t put cushions in .

Here are 5 tips for healthy cooking at home!⁠
⁠
1. Meal Plan Weekly…or Monthly⁠
There are endless meal planning and grocery list apps, downloads, calendars, and systems you can try based on your organization style.⁠

2. If You Want To Be Practical, Forget Making Everything From Scratch⁠
Today, there are many wonderful organic real pre-made foods you can buy. But the details count, especially if you’re healing. Click our link in bio to find our favorite brands and things to look out for.⁠
⁠
3. Double (Or Triple) Recipes When You Can⁠
Whenever you’re cooking something that will freeze well, double the recipe, and freeze what you don’t use for another night.⁠
⁠
4. Use an InstantPot⁠
Best. New. Kitchen. Appliance. Ever! ⁠

5. Always Have A Default Meal In Your Back Pocket⁠

Plastic vs. Hardwood,<Post CbkZrcpu8tV>,1371,39,[],26/03/22,"Plastic vs. Hardwood Cutting Boards⁠
⁠
We get a surprising number of inquiries on how to choose a quality, non-toxic cutting board and keep it clean. ⁠
⁠
And considering we all use cutting boards to prepare food every single day, this is an important issue to address when creating a healthy home.⁠
⁠
The best materials for any cutting board are either FSC-certified Solid Hardwood or Organic Bamboo.⁠
⁠
Three reasons why we avoid plastic cutting boards:⁠
1️⃣ They degrade overtime due to cutting and washing, which leaves grooves for germs and bacteria to hide out.⁠
2️⃣ Small pieces of plastic can creep into your food as the plastic is cut and degrades.⁠
3️⃣ They leach chemicals, like BPA, BFA, etc. into your food, especially if hot food is placed on the board.⁠
⁠
Fortunately, there are some wonderful companies who make this swap easy. Our favorite brands are Greener Chef, Canaryware, Treeboard, and Our Place. ⁠

⁠
There are a couple of ways to wash produce with BB. ⁠
⁠
SPRAY ⁠
Simply spray the produce with All-Purpose, wait approximately 30 seconds and rinse.⁠
⁠
SOAK⁠
For a deeper clean, fill up a clean sink with water and add 1 capful of Concentrate. Add the fresh produce and let it soak for a few minutes. Pull out and rinse. Then let it air dry on dish towels. Make sure to pull the produce out of the water before you drain the sink so it is not re-contaminated by the dirt that has accumulated at the bottom.",538,"[{'text': 'I am blown away!!
