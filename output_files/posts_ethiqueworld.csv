An estimated one billion plastic lipstick tubes end up in landfill or discarded in the environment every year. That's why we're revolutionising the cosmetic industry by creating products that have a better impact on the planet 💋

All of our product packaging is 100% plastic-free (yep, even the liner of our tubes!) and completely home-compostable. 

Once done, simply pop your Ethique product packaging into the compost, bury it in the soil or a plant pot where it will naturally break down and support new growth 🌱  Or you can pop it in with your recycling. 

No plastic, no laminate, no chlorines. Our packaging goes to the very heart of what we stand for 💚

They're highly pigmented, long-lasting, buildable and nourishing with a silky smooth finish. 

Pro tips:

❤️ When you need a long-lasting, bold colour, swipe the lipstick directly onto your lips or apply with a lip brush.
🧡 For a more matte-looking finish, blot lips with a tissue after application.
💛 After a soft, diffused look? Dab on colour with your fingertip.
🥰 For a cheeky blush, lightly apply and blend with a fingertip, sponge, or brush.

Introducing the @ethiquefoundation : a non-profit charitable organisation that builds on @ethiqueworld’s impact with a vision of a healthier, fairer world through innovation and regeneration.

Up until this point, Ethique have donated 2% of annual sales to charity which now equates to $2m. As Ethique has grown, so too have the donations, and this is where @briannemwest’s vision for the Ethique Foundation comes in.

The Ethique Foundation will support the people behind innovative, scalable solutions to our most pressing crises; climate change, biodiversity collapse, plastic pollution, and ocean destruction. 

With a clear focus, greater oversight and key external advisors, the Ethique Foundation will work with those looking to prevent these problems through long-term thinking and bold, regenerative initiatives.

We get asked a lot about mica, and rightly so - most mica is sourced from mines that (horrifyingly) use child labour. 

The mica we use is ethically sourced from the USA; however, to eradicate any traces of doubt, we're working on alternative colourants so we can say goodbye to mica for good 👋

Here's @briannemwest taking a deeper dive on mica and what we're looking to use next 💚

Some things don’t work as bars. We understand that. So we’ve solved that problem too.

Our handwash Concentrate is effective yet gentle and non-drying. Break up the concentrated blocks, add boiling water, mix and pour into your old handwash pump bottle you already own and voilà! It’s a win for the planet 🌏

Fact: the average household goes through 11 hand soap bottles a year. That’s almost 500 bottles per person for their working life!

The lightbulb moment that inspired Ethique was when @briannemwest dropped a bottle of shampoo in the shower and realised how ridiculous it was to have a bottle of shampoo contain so much water. Especially when used in a room FULL of water.

Water is wasted throughout the entire manufacturing process: from the product itself (most shampoo and conditioner bottles contain 70-95% water) to the plastic bottles they come in– one HDPE 350ml bottle. The size of a typical bottle from the supermarket requires 700ml of water to make.

In just over nine years, you’ve helped us save over 20 million single-use plastic bottles from ending up in landfill, saving 17.6 million litres of water 🤯

Thanks to your help, our #giveupthebottle revolution is far from slowing down. Our next goal: half a billion plastic bottles saved by 2030 💚

“so i’ve always wanted to try more sustainable options for my hair but i’ve also been kinda scared! i just didn’t think solid hair products would work for afro hair but then i found out about curliosity by @ethiqueworld n it changed ma life! 😍 i read the ingredients and jus knewww it was for me!! it’s a conditioner & co-wash bar and is full of all the good stuff like shea butter, jojoba, and cocoa butter which keeps my hair feeling super nourished and hydrated! 👏🏽⠀
⠀
@ethiqueworld products are also 
💗 vegan⠀
💗 cruelty-free⠀
💗 plastic-free (home-compostable packaging)⠀
💗 palm-oil free⠀
💗 made with directly traded ingredients ⠀
💗 & use naturally-derived ingredients ⠀
⠀
i’m literally in love! so glad i have been able to #giveupthebottle without compromising on the quality of the products i use or the health of my hair 😍 we love to see it 🙌🏽”
