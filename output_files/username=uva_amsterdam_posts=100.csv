Expectations are that the circumstances towards the end of August will allow for that. We are, of course, hopeful and optimistic.
🔹The Ministry of Education, Culture and Science has formulated a “base scenario” (in Dutch) and the OMT will issue a definitive recommendation in early July. As it currently stands, expectations for the new academic year are that higher education institutions will be allowed to open their doors, social distancing will no longer be required, and voluntary self-tests will remain available for those who are not vaccinated. 
🔹Face masks will likely remain compulsory while walking through the buildings, however, and we are currently operating under the assumption that lectures will be subject to a maximum of 75 persons starting from September. Naturally, we hope that this restriction will also be lifted.
🔹The UvA’s focus is on a return to on-campus education and being able to meet each other.  For students, that means that from September on, lectures will once again require you to be present in Amsterdam. The normal attendance requirements will be in effect. This also applies to foreign students. Only in special cases, e.g. for foreign students who are unable to attend due to international travel restrictions, programmes may explore additional solutions to enable students to receive education. 
🔹The decision to “return to normal” education is based on current developments. While we remain optimistic, we are also taking into account less ideal scenarios in which we have to (partly or temporarily) revert to online education. 
🔹Read more about lectures, exams, vaccinations and self-testing in the update via the link in bio or in our stories",2021-06-03 15:38:51,4

On that day, attention is paid to the moment a lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or other person (LGBT+) openly expresses a sexual orientation or gender identity: ‘coming out’. This is not a one-off event, because a new context with new people always requires a new legitimation or acceptance of someone's gender and / or sexuality. A (first) coming out can therefore be personal and vulnerable, but it is often experienced as a relief afterwards. What does that mean?

In this video, 5 students share their opinion on Coming Out Day❤️

Naomi: “Last March, at the start of the pandemic, I started rollerblading (along with the rest of the country I think). Rollerblades were pretty much sold out everywhere but eventually I managed to snag a pair 🛼 When I began rollerblading again I thought: wow, this is great! 

I started skating along the Amstel river 🌊 Sometimes I skated nearly 40 kilometers. I got lost once or twice but I always eventually managed to find my way home. Rollerblading is my escape from a computer screen. I don't really pick up the phone when I go rollerblading, so that I'm really able to turn off 🔇

The pandemic has helped me learn how important it is to make time for rest. I often meet up with friends and they'll come rollerblading with me or I'll rollerblade and they will run, skateboard, cycle. It's a lot of fun and COVID-proof!”

Some of our professors have their own outlook on Blue Monday. Their insights💡:

Reinout Wiers, professor of Developmental Psychopathology and co-director of the Centre for Urban Mental Health💬: ‘Almost half of the people meet lifetime criteria for a mental disorder; most prevalent are anxiety, depression and addictions. On Blue Monday, or another blue day during lockdown, this may be bearable, because we're all in the same boat. It becomes difficult when everyone else is having fun, and you can only watch through your window or telephone-screen.’

Claudi Bockting, professor in Clinical Psychology and co-director of the Centre for Urban Mental Health💬: Blue Monday is made up by advertising agencies to sell more sun vacations. There are effective treatments for depression and anxiety; a sun holiday is not amongst them. Interdisciplinary research, as executed in the Center for Urban Mental Health at our university, is crucial to achieve a breakthrough in this field.’",2021-01-18 16:21:36,9

Regrettably, it’s almost impossible to obtain sunscreen in Togo and therefore I found it important to do something about this. Together with a company, I developed a sunscreen which could be locally and cost effective produced. Currently more than 600 people with albinism in Togo are provided with sunscreen and their health is monitored.” ☀️

Comment 😱 if you never heard about the P.C.H. before and 😃 if this is no breaking news to you.

A little history class on the P.C. Hoofthuis 🏛️ The building is named after the historian, poet and play-wrighter Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft since his family house ‘In den Huypot’ was located here. Initially, the architects Aldo van Eyck and Theo Bosch worked together on the building but the design led to a break between the two. “You simply cannot hold a pencil with two people” Bosch explained ✏️. He finished the building under his own name in 1983.

Every year, the ECHO Awards are presented to outstanding students from non-western backgrounds who actively demonstrate social involvement 🎖️🥂.

Priscilla Maria: ‘I want to improve healthcare for everyone in the Netherlands, including the Dutch Caribbean islands, and make it more inclusive. Communication in healthcare is extremely important and linguistic and cultural differences have a major impact on communication.’

Marwa Ahmed: ‘In today's society, everyone is shouting that the doors are open for more diversity in business and education, but I don't think that’s enough. I want that passive approach to change to an active approach and I want organisations to make an effort to change the cultures that are now perceived as unwelcoming.’

“Although it is not possible to come together in groups at this moment, student associations are doing everything they can to stimulate connection between students. Especially now it is important to pay extra attention to each other and to keep in touch with one another. I see many great online initiatives from student associations such as painting workshops, sports lessons, debates, escape rooms and online ‘borrels’. In this manner you can be safe at home but you don't have to feel lonely. In addition, most student associations have counselors to whom students can turn to when something is going on. For example when students feel a little low or lonely. There are also activities open to non-members.""

Guusje: “I knew from a young age that I wanted to study in the big city, in Amsterdam. Before I managed to get this room, I lived in the Bijlmer neighbourhood, in the student hotel Casa and in an attic room at the Biesbosstraat. I’m glad I’ve finally found a spot that I really love. In this apartment I really feel at home, a feeling that I didn't experience in my previous rooms. During the process of searching for the right room, I sometimes thought: it’ll never happen... But my tip is: don’t give up hope, persistence always wins! 💪

Despite the fact that I really love it here, the hanging plant about my table does irritate me. To water it, I need to climb on my wobbly table. (Side note: while doing the interview, the UvA social team was also scared she’d fall and break some bones 🤪). But the plant is too cute to get rid of.

Rick: “When I was younger and living abroad, I had no choice than to pick up the local language. Ever since, I am intrigued by the science of language learning. And in addition to that, I don’t like feeling like a tourist when I am visiting a country 😁

I was supposed to go to South Korea after finishing my Bachelor’s degree past summer, but unfortunately that did not happen. I would like to live and work there for at least a few years in the future. So, having an (basic) understanding of the language is only going to be beneficial. Therefore, I started learning Korean during the lockdown. And also because Chinese or Japanese seemed too difficult to me (for now), ha-ha. I believe language learning is good for personal development and widening your view on the world by understanding how different cultures work. The Korean language is pleasant to the ears because of the specific intonation and the avoidance of hard consonants like the infamous Dutch letter ‘G’.

A quote I live by is “mind over matter”. I think it’s more important than ever before to focus on the things you can control. See the positives in life like grabbing a coffee with a friend or going for a walk. Try to invest in yourself a little more during these difficult times.”

Marte: ""My image is called 'Huidhonger', which means 'skin hunger' in Dutch. The word has become very popular during the pandemic, so I thought it would be interesting to take a picture with this word in my mind. The picture I took is about longing for some intimacy. I think it can be hopeful because it shows the strength of imagination.""",2021-05-19 08:04:07,12

These will apply for at least the coming four weeks. Below, you can read more about how these measures will impact the University of Amsterdam (UvA).
🔹In the short term, the government intends to make wearing face masks a legal requirement. At the UvA, this means that from now on, everyone will be wearing a face mask😷 in all indoor areas (corridors, lifts, halls, etc.) including the library until arriving at their destination. Once in a lecture room or office, face masks may be removed. If you prefer to continue wearing one, feel free to do so. In some spaces (e.g. laboratories)🥼 special guidelines apply, which take precedence over general UvA guidelines.
🔹Teaching activities at universities are exempt to the rule that gatherings must be in groups of 30 and under🧑‍🏫. Examinations can also continue without any group size limitations, although of course all the necessary precautionary measures will be taken. Study spaces👩‍💻 will also remain available for use. Students will be informed when any scheduled activities are cancelled.
🔹Teaching-related activities such as degree certificate and diploma award ceremonies🎓🥳 may continue, with a maximum of 30 people in attendance. In order to restrict travel as much as possible, considering any alternatives first, such as online options, is recommended. Unfortunately, a reception after the award ceremony is currently out of the question. 
🔹At an earlier point, events that were not directly related to education and research had already been postponed🔜. This will now also apply to events that are indeed related to education and research, such as small-scale symposia. Study association activities must also be cancelled, including those of an educational nature. Here too, the four-week period applies. In light of the importance of the study association activities for education📚, the related restrictions will be lifted as soon as possible✅.",2020-10-15 12:36:16,10

Femke: “At the start of the pandemic, I started searching for a new offline hobby. My mom had many beads and tools from when she used to make her own jewelry back in the days. So, I decided to start making my own jewelry with her old stock. I really like that I can create the jewelry I love myself. And, I use vintage and recycled beads so that it has as little impact on the environment as possible 👏 I love that this forces me to be creative with the beads that I can find.

Because of my hobby, I became good friends again with an old friend from high school. We hadn't spoken to each other for over two years but then she suddenly ordered some of my jewelry via Instagram. We got in touch again and now we're even making jewelry together 😃

To other students I want to say: enjoy the little things. During these times I try to look at what I do have, instead of what I don't have or what is not possible. Every day I think about the things I'm grateful for and these things then feel like little presents 🎁 It helps me experience positive vibes.”
